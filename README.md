### Hi there <img src="https://imgur.com/a/jLxmbBu" width="30px">


I am Sulaiman, currently an undergraduate student at Institut Teknologi Bandung. I had just fell in love with coding despite my main field is mathematics.

Few courses I completed:
* Harvard's CS50x on July 2020
* W3C's HTML5 and CSS3 Fundamentals on August 2020

So I'm kinda gonna explore more into full-stack web development, but I'm prepared to fall on my second love, if any

you can find me on...
