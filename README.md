### Hi there <img src="https://i.imgur.com/GijsHxg.gif" width="30px">

I am Sulaiman, currently an undergraduate student at Institut Teknologi Bandung. I had just fell in :purple_heart: with `coding` despite my main field is mathematics.

Few courses I have completed: :star:
- [x] Harvard's CS50x (*July 2020*)
- [x] W3C's HTML5 and CSS3 Fundamentals (*August 2020*)

So I'm kinda gonna explore more into **full-stack web development**, but I'm prepared to fall on my second :purple_heart:, if any~

You can find me on...
